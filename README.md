# [IN PROGRESS...] Ticket Management System for E-commerce and Traditional Stores

## This system allows users to:

- Store client information
- Create tickets for reporting issues.
  
When a client reports a problem or complaint, a ticket is generated and automatically routed to the relevant department in the company. The system also manages communication with clients and sends email notifications regarding ticket updates.
