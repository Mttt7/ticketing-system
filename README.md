This Ticket Management System is designed for businesses of all kinds, mainly for  e-commerce and traditional stores. 
It helps manage client issues, track tickets, and communicate effectively within the team to solve problems. 
The project is still being developed.
I'm currently wortking on:
- sending emails to customers
- an internal messaging system for team communication
- an Administrator Panel which will allow for live tracking of employee activity and work-time-tracking
- XML data import/export for custom configurations.
